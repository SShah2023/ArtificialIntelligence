AI-Powered Taxi Dispatch System: A modular simulation of a taxi dispatch system, featuring intelligent agents, dynamic traffic management, and real-time fare assignments in a grid-based world.

Artificial Intelligence: RoboUber Simulation
This repository implements an intelligent agent-based simulation for a taxi dispatch system, RoboUber. The project features a modular and scalable design, showcasing the application of AI techniques in transportation systems. Key highlights include:

Node Network System: A grid-based representation of the world, where each node manages traffic, occupancy, and fare generation. Nodes simulate real-world constraints such as capacity limits and gridlock scenarios.
Taxi Agent Logic: Taxis operate with decision-making capabilities, handling tasks like navigation, fare collection, and drop-offs while optimizing for efficiency.
Dynamic Dispatching: A dispatcher coordinates taxi assignments using intelligent strategies for balancing supply and demand in real-time.
Traffic Simulation: Models traffic flow, congestion, and time delays, integrating these factors into the taxi and dispatcher decision-making process.
Fare Management: Simulates fare generation, assignment, and completion, reflecting real-world scenarios of ride-hailing services.
The project showcases how AI can be applied to dynamic and real-time decision-making in transportation and logistics.
